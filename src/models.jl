    λ0_model(efficiencies, log_p0_nominal, x0_random_coin[, multiplicity_thr])

Expected fraction of events in which a SiPM channel sees no light.

Computes the expected fraction by looping over the rows (events) in
`log_p0_nominal`. It samples the expected light/no-light observable by combining
the probability to see no light `p0` with the random coincidence data (at
the same row index). If a multiplicity threshold is specified, events with
lower multiplicity are discarded.

# Arguments
All input data is keyed by detector name (a symbol)

- `efficiencies`: scaling factors for each SiPM channel.
- `log_p0_nominal`: logarithm of the probability to see no light for each
  (event, channel), typically from simulations.
- `x0_random_coin`: presence of light from random coincidences for each
  (event, channel). This is typically coming from a measurement.
- `multiplicity_thr`: discard events with multiplicity below this threshold
  (optional, defaults to 0).
- `n_rands`: average forward model results over this amount of random numbers.

# Returns
- Vector of expectation values for each channel, ordered as the input data
  structures.
